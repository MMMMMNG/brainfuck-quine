# brainfuck-quine
Written on my phone during down-time in the apprenticeship in 2019. The data portion was later generated with a JavaScript snippet.

I used [Tein van der Lugt's app](https://github.com/teinvdlugt/brainf-ck-interpreter) to run the code on my phone.

Test it with [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/brainfk).
